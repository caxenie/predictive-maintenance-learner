# Neural Network Predictive Maintenance System

Predictive maintenance of elevators doors in order to reduce unplanned stops and maximizing equipment life cycle.

*"If component A is showing over 20% baseline vibrations, while the temperature rises 0.5 degrees in component B, and the noise level rises with 10.6dB then it is likely that the doors will break in about 5 to 7 days.‚Äù*

Monitoring of elevator performance across 10+ parameters, such as:
- time it takes for doors to open and close
- ball bearing sensor
- vibration and noise level
- abnormal stops
- humidity, air pressure, and temperature etc.

Learn normal operative parameters and sensory correlations in order to:
- Define bounds for min/max ranges of critical parameters
- Generate alarms for anomaly situations (i.e. door not closing properly)
